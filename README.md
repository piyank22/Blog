#### Courses undertaken:
1. CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
2. (fast.ai part1) Deep Learning Part 1: Practical Deep Learning for Coders
3. (fast.ai part2) Deep Learning Part 2: Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders
4. CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
5. CMU CS 11-747, Neural Networks for NLP
6. CPSC 540: Machine Learning (Nando de Freitas)
7. (NOT done throughly) CS 228: Probabilistic Graphical Models (experimented with pyro.ai)

In addition to these courses I was also very actively reading research papers and implementing part of them, collectively with  resources most of the code that I have written is present here
