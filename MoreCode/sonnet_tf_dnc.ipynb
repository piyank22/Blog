The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

As of March 2015[update] The Princeton Review ranked Notre Dame as the ninth highest. The school has been previously criticized for its lack of diversity, and The Princeton Review ranks the university highly among schools at which \"Alternative Lifestyles [are] Not an Alternative.\" It has also been commended by some diversity oriented publications; Hispanic Magazine in 2004 ranked the university ninth on its list of the top–25 colleges for Latinos, and The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education recognized the university in 2006 for raising enrollment of African-American students. With 6,000 participants, the university\\'s intramural sports program was named in 2004 by Sports Illustrated as the best program in the country, while in 2007 The Princeton Review named it as the top school where \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.\" The annual Bookstore Basketball tournament is the largest outdoor five-on-five tournament in the world with over 700 teams participating each year, while the Notre Dame Men\\'s Boxing Club hosts the annual Bengal Bouts tournament that raises money for the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh.', 'qas': [{'answers': [{'answer_start': 71, 'text': '8,448'}], 'question': 'How many undergrads were attending Notre Dame in 2014?', 'id': '5733b5df4776f41900661105'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 196, 'text': '21–24%'}], 'question': 'What percentage of students at Notre Dame are the children of former Notre Dame students?', 'id': '5733b5df4776f41900661106'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1446, 'text': 'over 700'}], 'question': 'How many teams participate in the Notre Dame Bookstore Basketball tournament?', 'id': '5733b5df4776f41900661107'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1588, 'text': 'the Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh'}], 'question': 'For what cause is money raised at the Bengal Bouts tournament at Notre Dame?', 'id': '5733b5df4776f41900661108'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 49, 'text': '12,179'}], 'question': 'How many students in total were at Notre Dame in 2014?', 'id': '5733b5df4776f41900661109'}]}, {'context': \"About 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus.

The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence.

Schools started forming in the area before it was officially a territory as families started settling into the area. The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students each day out of the 81 students enrolled at the school. Sarah Raymond was paid at a rate of $125 per month, and Mrs. Farley was paid $75 per month. There were no textbooks used in the school. In their place was an assortment of books brought in by various emigrants. Sarah quit teaching the following year, but would later become the Madison County superintendent of schools.\", 'qas': [{'answers': [{'answer_start': 36, 'text': 'April 26, 1864'}], 'question': 'When was the Montana Territory formed?', 'id': '5734161dd058e614000b690e'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 369, 'text': '1862'}], 'question': 'When was the first formal school on record?', 'id': '5734161dd058e614000b690f'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 696, 'text': '$1.75'}], 'question': 'How much were students charged per week?', 'id': '5734161dd058e614000b6910'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1044, 'text': '1886'}], 'question': 'When did the first public school in Virginia City formed?', 'id': '5734161dd058e614000b6911'}]}, {'context': 'Montana contains thousands of named rivers and creeks, 450 miles (720 km) of which are known for \"blue-ribbon\" trout fishing.
